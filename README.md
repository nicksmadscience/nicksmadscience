### Hi, I'm Nick Piegari!

I'm a video producer and motion graphics designer with 15 years professional experience, and I'm pivoting to software development.

Also, I'm a mad scientist.  I stream live-coding, electronic music production, hardware hackery, and more on twitch.tv/nicksmadscience.  Come hang out with me and my pup, Mouse!

I'm currently on the lookout for a junior software development job.  On the way, I'm learning more about how to turn a 10+-year, very serious coding hobby into a profession.

How to reach me:  Shoot me an email at nickpiegari@gmail.com!

Pronouns:  he/they
